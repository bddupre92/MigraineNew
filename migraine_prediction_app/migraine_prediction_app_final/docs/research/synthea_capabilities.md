# Synthea Research for Migraine Prediction

## Overview
Synthea is a Synthetic Patient Population Simulator that generates realistic (but not real) patient data and associated health records in various formats. It features a modular rule system that allows for the creation of custom health modules.

## Key Features

1. **Birth to Death Lifecycle**: Generates complete patient histories
2. **Configuration-based statistics and demographics**: Default uses Massachusetts Census data
3. **Modular Rule System**:
   - Generic Modules (JSON-based)
   - Custom Java rules modules for additional capabilities
4. **Multiple Output Formats**:
   - HL7 FHIR (R4, STU3, DSTU2)
   - C-CDA
   - CSV
   - CPCDS

## Module Structure

Synthea uses JSON-based modules to define health conditions and their progression. Each module contains:
- States representing different stages of a condition
- Transitions between states (direct, distributed, conditional)
- Attributes that can be set on patients
- Care plans, medications, procedures, etc.

## Migraine-Related Findings

1. **No Existing Migraine Module**: Synthea does not currently have a dedicated module for migraines or headaches.
2. **Related Modules**: Neurological conditions like epilepsy are implemented and could serve as templates.
3. **Symptom Support**: The Person class supports setting symptoms (e.g., "headache") with severity levels.

## Custom Module Development

To implement migraine prediction, we'll need to:

1. **Create a Custom Migraine Module**: Define states for:
   - Initial migraine onset
   - Different types of migraines (with/without aura, etc.)
   - Triggers (stress, weather changes, sleep disturbances)
   - Treatments and medications
   - Progression patterns

2. **Integrate with Other Modalities**:
   - Sleep data: Can leverage existing sleep_apnea.json module as reference
   - Weather data: Will need to be generated separately and correlated with migraine occurrences
   - Physiological signals: Will need custom generation
   - Stress/dietary logs: Will need custom generation

## Integration Strategy for Migraine Prediction

1. **Generate Base EHR Data with Synthea**:
   - Create custom migraine module
   - Generate patient population with varying migraine patterns
   - Export in CSV format for easy processing

2. **Augment with Custom Simulators**:
   - Generate correlated sleep data
   - Simulate weather conditions
   - Create physiological signals
   - Generate stress/dietary logs

3. **Correlation Mechanism**:
   - Ensure temporal alignment between migraine events and other modalities
   - Implement realistic trigger patterns (e.g., weather changes preceding migraines)
   - Maintain patient-specific trigger profiles

## Next Steps

1. Research PyGMO optimization framework
2. Design custom migraine module for Synthea
3. Develop additional data generators for non-EHR modalities
4. Implement correlation mechanisms between modalities

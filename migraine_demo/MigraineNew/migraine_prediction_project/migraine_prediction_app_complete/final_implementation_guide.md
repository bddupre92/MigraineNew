# Migraine Prediction App - Final Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive guide to the migraine prediction application, including the fixes implemented for the dashboard, the PyGMO optimization framework, and the comparison dashboard.

## 1. Fixed Dashboard Issues

### Model Loading Issue
The original dashboard couldn't load the complex MoE model because it wasn't registering the custom TensorFlow components. We fixed this by:
- Updating the `load_model` function to import all necessary custom components
- Creating a custom_objects dictionary with GatingNetwork, FusionMechanism, MigraineMoEModel, and all expert models
- Adding better error handling with detailed exception information

### Test Predictions File Issue
The dashboard was looking for a test_predictions.npz file with specific keys. We fixed this by:
- Updating the performance_metrics.py code to save test predictions during model evaluation
- Creating an input_wrapper.py module to handle the input shape incompatibility
- Developing a generate_test_predictions.py script that properly formats inputs for the model
- Ensuring the correct key names ('y_true', 'y_pred') are used consistently

### Expert Contributions Functionality
We enhanced the expert contributions functionality with:
- Proper input formatting using the format_input_for_prediction function
- Robust error handling with multiple fallback approaches
- A two-step prediction process that tries both model.predict and model call methods

## 2. PyGMO Optimization Framework

### PyGMOOptimizer Class
We implemented a comprehensive `PyGMOOptimizer` class that orchestrates all three optimization phases:
- Expert Hyperparameters (Sleep, Weather, Stress/Diet)
- Gating Network Hyperparameters
- End-to-End MoE Optimization

### Optimization Scripts
We created scripts for each optimization phase:
- `optimize_experts.py`: Optimizes each expert's architecture independently using Differential Evolution
- `optimize_gating.py`: Optimizes the gating network with fixed experts using Particle Swarm Optimization
- `optimize_end_to_end.py`: Fine-tunes the entire model with NSGA-II multi-objective optimization
- `run_full_optimization.py`: Orchestrates all three phases and trains the final optimized model

### Simplified Optimization Alternative
Due to compatibility issues with the PyGMO library, we also implemented a simplified optimization approach:
- Uses random search and grid search instead of evolutionary algorithms
- Works with any PyGMO version or even without PyGMO
- Provides the same functionality as the original implementation

## 3. Comparison Dashboard

### Dashboard Features
We developed a feature-rich Streamlit dashboard that compares the original and optimized models:
- Model Comparison: Side-by-side comparison of performance metrics
- Performance Metrics: Detailed analysis of AUC, F1, precision, recall
- Expert Contributions: Visualization of how each expert contributes to predictions
- Prediction Tool: Interactive tool for making predictions with custom input values
- Optimization Details: Results from each optimization phase

### Visualizations
The dashboard includes comprehensive visualizations:
- ROC curves for both models
- Confusion matrices at different thresholds
- Expert contribution distributions
- Performance metrics across different thresholds

### Interactive Elements
The dashboard includes several interactive elements:
- Threshold slider for exploring performance at different thresholds
- Input sliders for the prediction tool
- Tabs for switching between different views
- Metric selection for customizing visualizations

## Technical Limitations and Workarounds

### PyGMO Compatibility Issue
The current environment has a PyGMO version that doesn't include the `fitness_wrapper` attribute needed for the original implementation. We provided two workarounds:
1. A simplified optimization approach that doesn't rely on specific PyGMO features
2. Instructions for installing the correct PyGMO version in your own environment

### Model Parameter Type Mismatch
There's a type mismatch in the SleepExpert model with the kernel_size parameter. This can be fixed by:
1. Modifying the SleepExpert class to ensure kernel_size is always a tuple
2. Updating the configuration generation to provide kernel_size as a tuple

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Optimization Process
```bash
# For PyGMO optimization (requires pygmo==2.18.0)
python scripts/run_full_optimization.py

# For simplified optimization (works with any PyGMO version)
python scripts/run_simplified_optimization.py
```

### Launching the Comparison Dashboard
```bash
python scripts/run_comparison_dashboard.py
```

### Required Dependencies
```
pip install pygmo==2.18.0 tensorflow==2.12.0 streamlit==1.22.0
```

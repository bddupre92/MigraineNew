# Migraine Prediction App - Final Performance Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the actual performance improvements achieved through our optimization process for the migraine prediction application. We successfully implemented a simplified optimization framework that produced real performance metrics, allowing us to compare the original FuseMoE model with our optimized version.

### Key Performance Metrics

| Metric | Original Model | Optimized Model | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| AUC | 0.5084 | 0.5680 | +11.7% |
| Accuracy | 0.9400 | 0.9400 | 0% |
| Precision | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0% |
| Recall | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0% |
| F1 Score | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0% |

The optimization process resulted in a modest improvement in AUC score, indicating better ranking of migraine risk. However, both models still struggle with precision and recall at the default threshold, primarily due to class imbalance issues.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fixed Dashboard Issues

We successfully resolved several technical issues with the original dashboard:

- Fixed model loading by properly registering custom TensorFlow components
- Resolved test predictions file issues with proper key naming
- Enhanced expert contributions functionality with robust error handling

### 2. Optimization Framework

We implemented a simplified optimization framework that:

- Optimizes expert model hyperparameters
- Enhances the gating network for better expert integration
- Performs end-to-end fine-tuning of the entire model

### 3. Performance Visualization

We created a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes:

- Side-by-side comparison of model performance metrics
- ROC curves and confusion matrices
- Expert contribution analysis
- Interactive prediction tool
- Optimization details and results

## Analysis of Results

### Class Imbalance Impact

The high accuracy (94%) with low precision/recall indicates the models are biased toward the majority class (no migraine) due to the imbalanced dataset (only 6% positive cases).

### Threshold Analysis

Our analysis shows that adjusting the classification threshold could potentially improve precision and recall:

- Lower thresholds (0.2-0.3) increase sensitivity (recall)
- This ensures potential migraine days are not missed, even at the cost of some false positives

### Expert Contributions

The optimized model shows more balanced contributions across experts:

- Original Model: Stress/Diet (40%), Sleep (35%), Weather (25%)
- Optimized Model: Sleep (30%), Stress/Diet (30%), Weather (20%), Physio (20%)

## Recommendations for >95% Performance

To achieve the target of >95% performance metrics, we recommend:

### 1. Class Balancing Techniques

- Implement SMOTE or other oversampling techniques
- Use class weights in the loss function
- Explore focal loss to focus on hard examples

### 2. Feature Engineering

- Develop more sophisticated features for each expert
- Incorporate temporal patterns and trends
- Add interaction features between different data domains

### 3. Threshold Optimization

- Use precision-recall curves to find optimal threshold
- Consider different thresholds for different use cases
- Implement cost-sensitive learning

### 4. Advanced Architectures

- Explore attention mechanisms for better feature integration
- Implement transformer-based models for temporal data
- Develop hierarchical models for multi-scale patterns

## Conclusion

While our optimization process achieved a modest improvement in AUC score, further enhancements are needed to reach the target of >95% performance metrics. The current implementation provides a solid foundation for these future improvements, with a comprehensive dashboard for visualizing model performance and an optimization framework that can be extended with more sophisticated techniques.
